WordNerd is an AI powered vocabulary-building app for Hebrew speakers learning English. Using Transformer-based language models, WordNerd provides dynamic and personalized feedback. This is crucial, as most languages are flexible and fluid: they don’t follow exact rules, making them rich and alive, but also challenging to acquire. Hence the need for a non-binary feedback. Below are visuals of **some** of the application's UX:


**Home**  
Here the user can choose whether to practice his current cycle - which contains all the clusters he is memorizing at this period in time. Also, it's optional to view current progress and details regarding preferred system settings.

**Quiz**  
For each one of the three days (of a cycle), you are quizzed on the words in your current batch/es. Each quiz appends a score to your total "familiarity score".

**Cycle Initialization**  
At the beginning of each interval, the user wipes-out words he already knows, resetting his batches for the next cycle.
