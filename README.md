# the WordNerd
WordNerd is a smart vocabulary-building app for English learners. Using transformer-powered language models, WordNerd provides dynamic and personalized feedback. This is crucial, as most languages are flexible and fluid: they don’t follow exact rules, making languages rich but also challenging to acquire. Hence, the need for a non-binary feedback. Below are visuals of **some** of the application's UX:


**Home**  
Here the user can choose wether to practice his current cycle - which contains all the clusters he is memorizing at this period in time.Also, there is an option to view current progress and details regarding his preferred system settings.

**Quiz**  
For each one of the three days of the cycle, you are quizzed on the words in your current batch/es. Each quiz appends a score to your total "familiarity score".

**Cycle Initialization**
At the beginning of each interval, the user wipes-out words he already knows, resetting his batches for the upcoming interval.
